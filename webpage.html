				<p class="p1" style="font-family:Georgia; font-size:20px; color:white;"> If you want to build your own pc this guide is helpful, First thing to do is know the requirement
					in for pc there's a component that you need to work for it and a step or instruction to
					how assemble the parts. Picking the right components for the build you need can be a daunting 
					process at first, but once you dive in, you’ll see that it’s not only surprisingly simple, 
					it’s a heck of a lot of fun. This guide is by no means meant to be exhaustive, 
					it’s more a primer on what you’ll need to know to gather up 
					the right parts, and start putting your dream build together.

				<p class="p2" style="font-family:Courier New; font-size:20px; color:white;">
					Every other component plugs into this 
					circuit board. It’s the highway they use to communicate and collaborate. 
					They come in different sizes and configurations, and each one looks a little different, 
					but they all fill the same function. Make sure you know which processor 
					you want before you buy a motherboard.<br></br>
					Motherboards come in a couple of flavors, but the most important thing to know is what kind of socket it has. There are 
					basically two: LGA and AM. You'll always see them listed with a number after them, like “LGA1150” or “AM3.” The exact numbers
					after the LGA and AM portions of these socket names will change over time, to indicate which generation of Intel or AMD chips 
					they support, but the current standards as of 2022 (which will work with the latest chips from either maker) are LGA1200 for 
					Intel and AM4 for AMD.
				</p>
		
			<h2 class="h1" id="processor" style="font-family:Lucida Console; color:white;">Processor (CPU): </h2>
			 <img class="img1" src="https://i.pcmag.com/imagery/articles/05TxnWICQPuxBRS3a5QD3Cb-11.fit_lim.size_1050x.jpg" width=600px; height=450px; >
				<p class="p2" style="font-family:Courier New; font-size:20px; color:white;">
					This is the brain of your computer. It sockets directly into the motherboard, and it’s the 
					single most important component of your PC. That doesn’t mean it has to be the most expensive 
					(we’ll get to that later). If the CPU doesn't mention including thermal paste, get some. 
					Don't eat your CPU. I know it looks tasty, but it's not actually food.  	
				</p>
				
			<h2 class="h1" id="graphics card" style="font-family:Lucida Console; color:white;">Graphics Card (GPU): </h2>
			 <img class="img1" src="https://www.notebookcheck.net/fileadmin/Notebooks/News/_nc3/asus_boards.jpg" width=600px; height=450px; >
				<p class="p2" style="font-family:Courier New; font-size:20px; color:white;"> 
					If you’ll be playing games on this PC, you’ll need a graphics processing unit 
					(also called a graphics card). This is a specialized processor that’s designed and optimized 
					for handling visual data like the graphics in games. It's also used in video and photo editing
					and other graphics-intensive tasks. 
				</p>
				
			<h2 class="h1" id="storage" style="font-family:Lucida Console; color:white;">Storage: </h2>
			 <img class="img1" src="https://d30xqvs6b65d10.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/3d04ad.jpg" width=600px; height=450px; >
				<p class="p2" style="font-family:Courier New; font-size:20px; color:white;">
					This is your PC’s walk-in closet. This is where you store all your files, your games, your movies,
					your documents, your photos, your everything. You can always add more storage later. Theirs two types of
					storage HDD and SSD.
				</p>
				
			<h2 class="h1" id="memory" style="font-family:Lucida Console; color:white;">Memory (RAM): </h2>
			 <img class="img1" src="https://media.istockphoto.com/photos/computer-ram-picture-id92434128?k=20&m=92434128&s=612x612&w=0&h=dVmawp6bhuZF2a-b0qdZuFzhNGdJ_iDcJ-JWYvN14mY=" width=600px; height=450px; >
				<p class="p2" style="font-family:Courier New; font-size:20px; color:white;"> 
					You’ll see a lot of the same terms when you’re looking at memory and storage,
					but they’re very different. Memory is more like that one table you toss things on to deal with later. 
					It’s scratch paper; it’s short-term. It’s very important, though, because software uses memory to cache 
					(temporarily store) data in a place where it can be retrieved quickly.
				</p>
				
			<h2 class="h1" id="power supply" style="font-family:Lucida Console; color:white;">Power Supply (PSU): </h2>
			 <img class="img1" src="https://www.idgcdn.com.au/article/images/800x800/dimg/evga-power-supply-100883513-orig.jpg" width=600px; height=450px; >
				<p class="p2" style="font-family:Courier New; font-size:20px; color:white;"> 
					Your power supply unit is a little box that keeps the electricity running to every component. 
					It determines how quick and powerful your PC can be. The faster it is, the more power it needs,
					and you always want to have a little more than you need, just in case. Just like GPUs, PSUs are 
					also in and out of stock right now. 
				</p>
				
			<h2 class="h1" id="case & cooler" style="font-family:Lucida Console; color:white;">Case & Cooler: </h2>

				<p class="p2" style="font-family:Courier New; font-size:20px; color:white;"> 
					Your case is just what it sounds like. It’s a metal box. It might be covered in glass panels 
					and etched aluminum, but inside it’s just a big metal box that holds everything together. 
					Make sure you match it up with your motherboard size. For example, if you have an ATX motherboard, 
					you need an ATX (or “full-size”) case.

					When you build a PC, you don't automatically have Windows included. 
					You'll have to buy a license from Microsoft or another vendor and make a USB key to install it. 
					Or you can check out the newly released Windows 11.
					Here’s a little more information about what all you get out of the newest version of Windows.

			<h1 style="font-family:Lucida Console; color:white;"> Steps For Assemble The Parts: </h1>

				.web_.1072.603.jpg" alt="" width=1300px; height=700px;>
				<p class="p1" style="font-family:Courier New; font-size:20px; color:white;"> First, prep yourself a clean workspace. This can be a dining room table, a cleared-off 
					desk—just any surface big enough for your case to lay flat on its side, with ample room 
					around it for the rest of your components. You’ll also need a Phillips-head screwdriver 
					that will fit the screws on your case. When you put these parts together, be sure to 
					discharge any static buildup and work on a nonmetallic surface like a wooden table. 
					Or you could just assemble the motherboard on top of the cardboard box it comes in.
				<br></br>
					Most of the components you bought are going to come with instruction manuals; 
					keep them handy. We’re going to start with the motherboard, so open up the instruction manual 
					to the installation page. It can be pretty intimidating—there’s a lot to look at—but think of
					all this as a big Lego set. Each piece fits into each other piece. For the motherboard, your 
					first job is going to be seating your CPU.

				</ul>
			
			<h2 class="h1" id="step1" style="font-family:Lucida Console; color:white;">STEP 1:Installing Your CPU</h2>
		 
				<p class="p2" style="font-family:Courier New; font-size:15px; color:white;" >
					Depending on what kind of CPU you purchased (Intel or AMD), the chip will have either little
					prongs on one side (don’t touch them) or little golden contacts on one side 
					(don’t touch them). Seriously, don’t touch that side of your chip. Oils from your fingertips 
					can damage the contacts, or you might bend a pin. Do either one and your processor becomes 
					nothing more than an expensive hunk of silicon.
				<br></br>
					Seating your processor is pretty easy. First, 
					double-check your motherboard’s instructions and make sure you’ve unlocked the processor 
					socket. It’ll be a big square with a bunch of little holes (or contacts), with a lever or 
					button beside it. Your motherboard’s instructions will say explicitly how to unlock the 
					socket so you can put your processor in without any issues.
				<br></br>
					Once you’ve confirmed that it’s 
					unlocked and ready, just find which corner of your processor has a little golden triangle 
					and line it up with the same symbol on your motherboard’s processor socket. Gently lower the
					processor into the socket, then gently flip the latch or locking mechanism. You shouldn’t 
					have to fight it. If you have to press really hard, double-check that the processor is 
					socketed correctly.
				<br></br>
					Next, you’re going to need your thermal paste. That little tiny plastic syringe of silvery 
					goo is very important for this next step. Now that your processor is seated, take a look at 
					the shiny square of silicon in the center of it. That’s where your heat sink is going to sit.
					Your processor came with a heat sink, and on one side of it, you’ll see a copper circle. 
					You’re going to be putting the heat sink directly on top of the processor after we apply 
					the thermal paste, with the silicone square and the copper circle lining up perfectly.
				<br></br>
					Go ahead and carefully squeeze a tiny ball (no bigger than a pea) of thermal paste onto the
					silicon square on your processor. You’ll want it as close to the center as you can get.
				<br></br>
					Now line up your heat sink with the screws surrounding your processor, and gently lower it 
					into place. You’re gonna squish the thermal paste, and the goal here is to create a thin
					layer covering the back of your processor. It’s OK if it oozes a little bit, but if it oozes
					out and over the edge of the processor, you used too much. Get some isopropyl alcohol, 
					dab it on a lint-free wipe, and wipe the processor and heat sink. Wait till they’re
					thoroughly dry and try again.
				<br></br>
					If it looks all right, screw your heat sink into place. Flip back to your motherboard 
					instruction book and find the right place near the processor socket to plug in your heat 
					sink’s cooling fan. It should be very close to your processor socket. Once you’ve found it, 
					plug it in—congratulations, you just installed a CPU. This was the hardest part, 
					and it’s over. Good job!
				</p>	
		 
			<h2 class="h1" id="step2" style="font-family:Lucida Console; color:white;">STEP 2:Installing Your Storage and Memory</h2>
		 
				<p class="p2" style="font-family:Courier New; font-size:15px; color:white;" >
					Memory is maybe the easiest thing to install. See those vertical little sockets beside the
					CPU? Line up your sticks of RAM and slot them in, starting from the left-hand slot. 
					They’ll lock into place once you’ve seated them properly. If you have two sticks of RAM,
					make sure to skip a slot between them. Your motherboard manual should say which slots to use.
				<br></br>
					For your hard drive or solid-state drive (SSD), find an empty bay in the front-facing part 
					of your case. Slide your drive in and screw it into place. If you have an M.2 drive
					(a tiny SSD about the size of a stick of gum), there should be a place on the motherboard 
					where you slot it in directly. Check out your motherboard’s manual to see where the M.2 slot
					is if you can't find it.
				</p>	
		  
			<h2 class="h1" id="step3" style="font-family:Lucida Console; color:white;">STEP 3:Installing Your Motherboard and Power Supply</h2>
		
				<p class="p2" style="font-family:Courier New; font-size:15px; color:white;" >
					The rest of this is formulaic. Start by putting your motherboard into your case. 
					Consult your motherboard’s instructions, line up the screw holes in the case with the ones
					on your motherboard, and get to work.
				<br></br>
					Next, you’ll want to install your power supply. There should be a spot for it near the top
					or bottom of the case, a big square spot that will fit your supply perfectly. If you’re
					having trouble finding it, look at the back of your case: There’ll be a big empty square. 
					That’s where the power supply goes (and where you’ll plug in your PC when you’re all done).
					Once you've found its home, slot it in and screw it into place.
				<br></br>
					Make sure all the snaky cables coming out of the power supply will reach your motherboard
					with room to spare. Don’t plug in anything yet; we’re going to come back to the power supply
					in a bit.
				</p>
				
			<h2 class="h1" id="step4" style="font-family:Lucida Console; color:white;">STEP 4:Installing Your Graphics Card</h2>

				<p class="p2" style="font-family:Courier New; font-size:15px; color:white;" >
					Your GPU is going to be pretty big. Even a modestly powerful GPU like the GTX 1060 is large
					compared to your other components. That means how it fits into your case is important. 
					Once you put your GPU in there, space is going to start getting tight.
				<br></br>
					Flip open your motherboard’s instruction book again and look for a PCIe slot. It’s going to
					be a horizontal slot with a little plastic latch beside it, near the middle or bottom of
					your motherboard. That’s where the GPU plugs in. All you need to do is identify the back 
					of your GPU (the side with the HDMI and DisplayPorts), line that up with the back of your 
					case, and push the GPU into the horizontal slot. It should lock into place easily enough; if
					it doesn’t, make sure you’re inserting it correctly.
				<br></br>
					Find another one of those tiny little screws and fasten your GPU to the case. 
					There’s a little spot for that on the same piece of metal with the HDMI ports. 
					It should be easy to find.
				<br></br>
					Now, take a look at the cables coming out of your power supply. There should be a few that
					look like they could fit into the square (or rectangular) socket on the side of your GPU. 
					It should look like six or eight little holes in a rectangle shape.
				</p>
				
			<h2 class="h1" id="step5" style="font-family:Lucida Console; color:white;">STEP 5:Ribbon Cables</h2>
		 
				<p class="p2" style="font-family:Courier New; font-size:15px; color:white;" >
					The motherboard needs to be hooked into all your devices. The power supply unit I used in
					this build is what's called fully modular, which means that you can select the cables you 
					need and leave the rest off to eliminate clutter. Otherwise, power supplies have a ton of 
					cables, and you'll have to deal with the unused power connections dangling inside your case. 
					You'll need to connect the PSU to the SSD and the motherboard.
				<br></br>
					You also need to plug the motherboard into your case—the power buttons, audio plugs, and
					USB ports on the front of your case. There are special headers for each kind of plug 
					scattered around the board, so you'll want to check your manual for the location and 
					function of each grouping of pins. These tiny pins need to be plugged in a certain way, and 
					they're unbelievably minuscule. There's also a hookup for the case's fan—in the case I used 
					there was one header on the motherboard but three fans installed. Then there's the SATA cable
					for your SSD, which plugs into the motherboard.
				<br></br>
					This part of your build really depends on the hardware you purchased, so consult the
					manuals for each component to ensure you've correctly plugged it into your motherboard 
					and the power supply.
				</p>

			<h2 class="h1" id="step6" style="font-family:Lucida Console; color:white;">STEP 6:Boot It Up and Install Windows</h2> 
		
				<p class="p2" style="font-family:Courier New; font-size:15px; color:white;" >
					The final stage of your build is a simple one: Hit your power button. If the PC whirs to 
					life, you probably put it together perfectly! If it doesn't, don't despair. There are 
					a lot of potential problems that could cause a PC to fail to boot up for the first time.
				<br></br>
					There's also a chance you could have received faulty components. if you’re having trouble 
					with a specific component, YouTube is your friend. There are tons of helpful PC-building 
					tutorials.
				</p>
		
			<h2 class="h1" id="step7" style="font-family:Lucida Console; color:white;">STEP 7:You Finish it!</h2> 
		 
				<p class="p2" style="font-family:Courier New; font-size:15px; color:white;" >
					Congratulations on building your first PC. It's a bit of a pain, but it's a great way to 
					spend an afternoon. Or a couple of days, depending on how many unforeseen headaches you
					run into.
